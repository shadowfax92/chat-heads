Chat heads (Android)
====================
Welcome to the Chat heads Wiki
Chat heads is an android Application that simplifies how messaging is done in Android devices. It uses something called floating windows to display new messages that arrive on your android phone. Advantage of doing this is that you don't have to move away from your current app to reply to messages!


##Code structure
- Lastest version of the code is present here. Before this version, I had two other versions [chat_heads_v1](https://github.com/shadowfax92/CH_Android) and [chat_heads_v2](https://github.com/shadowfax92/CH_v3). Both of these versions where separate repositories. So, to unify all code under a single directory, I have added the two versions in a separate sub-directory name chat_heads_v1, chat_heads_v2 respectively. Sorry for the inconvenience.
